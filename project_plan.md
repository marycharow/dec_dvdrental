# Project Plan

## Objective
Our objective is to extract datasets from the DVD rental PostgreSQL database to create tables that can be used for financial reporting and insights.

## Consumers
The consumers of our data would be financial and product analysts looking to derive insights on sales performance regarding store location and film type(s), allowing them to make business decisions to optimize investment.

## Questions
What is the rental sales performance by fiscal time period (e.g. day, week, quarter, year)?

When do rental volumes spike or drop?

Which regions and/or stores drive the highest rental sales and which are the lowest performers?

Which types of films have the highest/lowest rental sales?
